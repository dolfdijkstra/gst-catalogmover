CatalogMover

  This project was created out of the need to do diffs on elements. It is a partial replacement of CatalogMover, with  more potential.
  

  
  Traditional CatalogMover does not order the rows in any catalog.html file in a pre-determined
  order, making diffs difficult.

  Currrently on the export functionality is exposed via the command-line. There is also import and advanced filtering and selection possible. 
  Currently primary row regex pattern matching is implemented.  
    
Usage

  There are two ways to invoke the tool
  
  * with the settings defined on the command-line:
  
  <<<java -jar gst-catalogmover-x.x.jar --host=http://localhost:8080/cs/CatalogManager --user=ContentServer --password=password --pattern=Support/.*>>>
  
  * or from a properties file:
  
  <<<java -jar gst-catalogmover-x.x.jar \<file.properties\> >>>

  Sample properties file

-----
host=http://localhost:8080/cs/CatalogManager
user=ContentServer
password=password
#target=target/localhost_8080
pattern=Support/.*
#proxy_host=myproxyhost
#proxy_port=8080
#proxy_user=authproxy
#proxy_password=letmein
#catalogs=ElementCatalog,SiteCatalog,SystemSQL

Options
 
  The property file or the command like accepts various options. The command-line version takes the same options as the properties file. 
  The options on the command like must be pre-pended with <<<-->>> and the key needs to be followed by a equals (=) sign and the value.   
    
    * host: [REQUIRED] Host,port and path to the CatalogManager servlet

    * user: [REQUIRED] Username of the ContentServer user

    * password: [OPTIONAL] Password of the ContentServer user. If not provided, you will be asked to enter it.

    * pattern: [OPTIONAL] Regular expression (java syntax) for the primary key selector. 

    * target: [OPTIONAL] the location where the catalogs will be saved.\    
      Defaults to  target/\<host\>_\<port\>
   
    * proxy_host: [OPTIONAL] 
    
    * proxy_port: [OPTIONAL] 
    
    * proxy_user: [OPTIONAL]
     
    * proxy_password: [OPTIONAL]
     
    * catalogs: [OPTIONAL]  the catalogs to download, comma seperated.\     
      Default values are <<<ElementCatalog,SiteCatalog,SystemSQL>>>.\       
      Setting this to SystemInfo will download all catalogs!
    
    
  Further use
    There is a powerfull architecture implemented, that allows for very advanced selection of tables and rows, based on an event model. 
    The export of one row, can lead to download of other rows. Check out the source code and read the code and javadocs for further inspriration.
